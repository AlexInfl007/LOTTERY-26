Wait, let me reconsider the input. The modified files are only `src/components/WalletConnect.jsx` and `src/utils/ethersUtils.js` - these are source code files. There are no build artifacts, dependency directories, or temporary files in the changes shown.

Actually, looking more carefully at the example format and the rule that if the changes contain only source/config files with no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output nothing.

But the current .gitignore has content that should be preserved. Let me re-read...

The current .gitignore content is not provided as empty in the main input, so I need to consider what's already there. However, the main input shows only JSX and JS source files being modified.

Since only source code files are being modified and no artifacts are present, and the instruction says to preserve reasonable rules from current .gitignore unless clearly outdated, but we don't see the current content in the main input... Wait, the prompt says "current .gitignore Content" but it's empty in the template.

Given the modified files are just source code (.jsx, .js) and no artifacts are listed, the output should be empty according to rule #6.
